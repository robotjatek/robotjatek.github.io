    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>TLDR: C#, Java, <i>mostly</i> backend, <i>sometimes</i> frontend, a little bit of C++ in the past, a lot of fun pet projects in my freetime</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I am a backend developer <i>(well... mostly)</i> at an outsourcing company. My main responsibility is to write custom software for enterprise clients from all over the world.
            I have been working in mid-to-large size teams, but there were some instances when I was a one-man army.
            Although my main focus is backend development, there are a lot of instances when I write frontend code too. Over the years I had the opportunity to try a lot of different techstacks from Java to C# and from Angular to React.
            In the recent years I worked on webshops, a fire monitoring application, a custom site for a wellness resort where they monitored different health indicators of their guests with a smart handband.
            I have some code in an ice damage prevention software to protect crops from ice damage. And many more. And this is just my professional carreer because...

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I do what I really like in IT: pet-projects which are considered to be <i>niche</i> by many. 
            These can be really anything from emulation software, to computer graphics or a plain simple website. It really does not matter what, it just needs to be f-u-n.
            Just take a look at the <a href="#projects">projects</a> page to have some idea of the extent of my professional interests. 
            You will find game engines, an application launcher for Android, multiple emulation softwares (e.g.: a NES, a PSX, and a CHIP16 emulator) some are written in C# some in C++.
            And this is only a small subset of what I did in the previous years. Most of my projects are unfortunately lost to time. 
            I had many: I started programming when I was 12. Now It's almost 20 years later.
